# What is a Game Move?

A Game Move starts with an existing [[Node]] in a [[K-Hub]] and ends by adding a new child [[Node]] to it. It advances the [[Quest]] in some significant way. The Game Move may involve one or more tasks and one or more [[Node]]s.

[[SenseCraft]] encourages excellent Game Moves through [[Rule]]s imposed on [[Role]]s and by rewarding [[Conversational Literacy]].
