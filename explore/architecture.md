# Software Architecture

Do we have a strategy to follow? If we break down the application into independent modules that communicate solely through an api, we can optimize our engineering and software efficiency. One approach is [micro services](https://microservices.io/).

What is a good list of modules? Here's my attempt.

1. authentication
2. rules
3. roles
4. actions
6. web services (remote api)
8. manage tree
9. scoring
10. levels
11. groups
12. UI
	1. forms
	2. render tree
