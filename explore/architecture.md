# Software Architecture

Do we have a strategy to follow? If we break down the application into independent modules that communicate solely through an api, we can optimize our engineering and software efficiency. One approach is [micro services](https://microservices.io/).

What is a good list of modules? Here's my attempt.

1. authentication
2. rules
3. actions
4. roles
5. UI
6. web services (remote api)
