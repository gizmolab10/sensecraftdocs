# Simplest

My perception of [[../|sensecraft]] is of rules, roles, quests, guilds, k-hubs, rewards, and conversational literacy. Each has its subtleties and influences. Although it bears strong resemblance to successful gaming tools and gives those who are already familiar something familiar. However, for those who aren't familiar, perhaps we can start with something simpler, and introduce the rest later as mechanical details.

Would it be fair to say that each player in [[../|sensecraft]] takes on a wicked problem, with others as a group, working on it until they create a solution?

Working on it involves conjectures and critique. Begin with taking a guess at explaining the problem. Follow this with critique, using research, and reasoning to decide the truth of the guess. If a flaw or fallacy or conflict shows up, a new guess is needed. The final guess is one which passes such deep scrutiny. It then guides creation of the solution.

The mechanical details give people a way to refine their focus and effort.
