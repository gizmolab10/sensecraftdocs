# Mind Maps

I want to rebuild [Seriously](https://seriouslythink.com) (a mind map tool) as an app that can be imported into web pages.  

Aaditya feels that maps can convey a lot. Important relationships, influences, complexity. He has some mermaid snapshots but importing them here isn't yet done.

Aaditya: since these are written in plain text, I can selectively render only certain portions of it on-demand to easily visualize. Would be trivial to write a program that _hides_ or _collapses_ certain parts of a mindmap by not passing them to mermaid. Rendering is the hard part for me and that's handled well through 

[mermaid](https://mermaid.live/)  

In the long run, we both want to be able to integrate hierarchal maps into [[../|SenseCraft]] to allow users to visually convey concepts through simple diagrams. Both GitHub and GitLab already do this in their issues / comments / wikis.
