# Mind Maps

I want to rebuild [Seriously](https://seriouslythink.com) as an app that can be imported into web pages.  

Aaditya feels that maps have can convey a lot. Important relationships, influences, complexity. He has some mermaid snapshots but I am strugging to import them here.

Aaditya: since these are written in plain text, I can selectively render only certain portions of it on-demand to easily visualize. Would be trivial to write a program that _hides_ or _collapses_ certain parts of a mindmap by not passing them to mermaid.

Rendering is the hard part for me and that's handled well through 

[mermaid](https://mermaid.live/)  

In the long run- want to be able to integrate this into SenseCraft to allow users to visually convey concepts through simple diagrams. GitHub / GitLab already do this in their issues / comments / wikis.
