# Our Meeting Thursday 12 january 2023

Aaditya and I talked for a couple of hours and decided to tackle understanding Sense Craft by writing our questions out. We also want to analyze the design. He expressed the importance of having easily portioned pieces. I agree. A project manager or a software architect would be ideal. However at present, we felt capable of diving in and want to get our feet on the ground. What's the best approach? We decided on these steps:

1.  digest and discuss existing corpus of material (gather [[links]] to all of it)
2.  transfer Matrix material into a permanent separate website (done. this is it)
	1. for now, I did it manually and that was surprisingly tedious
3.  develop a bot to export Matrix channel content into curated wiki pages
2. vigorously explore various core topics

## Core Discussion Topics

[[architecture]]  
[[simplicity]]  
[[mindmaps]]
