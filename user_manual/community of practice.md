# What is a Community of Practice?

Some [[guild]]s provide training and are known as a Community of Practice. Such Guilds do not perform Quests. Instead, the provide guidance, manuals, classes and mentoring.

These are provisionally called Learning Guilds.

## Request for Guidance

As you play, if you need extra insight into, say, [[conversational literacy]], a [[role]] or a [[game move]], find the Community of Practice [[guild]] whose training comes closest and pose a Request for Guidance. The more quickly that that [[guild]] response to your request, the faster yoy can resume your contributions to [[../|sensecraft]], so such requests probably need to be prioritized and the response process optimized by [[../|sensecraft]].
