# What is a Game Move?

A Game Move starts with an existing [[node]] in a [[k-hub]] and ends by adding a new child [[node]] to it. It advances the [[quest]] in some significant way. The Game Move may involve one or more tasks and one or more [[node]]s.

[[../|sensecraft]] encourages excellent Game Moves through [[rule]]s imposed on [[role]]s and by rewarding [[conversational literacy]].
