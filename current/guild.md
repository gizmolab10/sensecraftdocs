# What is a Guild?

A Guild is a private space for one or more small groups to work together to contribute to a [[quest]]. Guilds are responsible for organizing these small groups and train them to pursue [[quest]]s with masterful [[conversational literacy]].

Each member of a Guild plays a specific [[role]].

It may come to pass that some Guilds evolve to just ask questions, others to formulate only positions with evidence, and yet others to challenge all [[game move]]s. A Guild which does this or which provides training is known as a [[community of practice]].

In the [[quest]]/[[guild]]/[[k-hub]] model, only [[guild]]s can provide curated [[quest]] results to the [[quest]]’s associated [[k-hub]].

Okay then, [[how do i join a guild]]?
