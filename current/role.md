# What are SenseCraft Roles?

A **Role** is a set of rules [[rule]]s governing which tasks and [[game move]]s a player assigned that role can or must perform. New players may need to learn [[skill]]s in order to adopt a **Role**. They should know what **Role** they want to play before joining a [[guild]]. Each of these will have its own specialty documentation.

## Basic Roles

There are six basic **Roles**, each having specialized responsibilities, partially described here.

Role | Responsibility
:---: | ---
Leader | organize the [[guild]], approve all [[game move]]s, invent new Roles
Researcher | find supportive material
Philosopher | help plan [[game move]]s and nurture epistemology (see below)
Scribe | convert a guild's [[game move]]s into a [[narrative]]
Critic | 
Default | learn enough to adopt a role, banned from [[guild]]s

>**Temporary Acting Leader Role**
>
>If the **Leader** must be absent for a period of time, they can temporarily bestow the **Role** of **Acting Leader** to any fellow [[guild]] member, so as not to freeze [[game move]]s.

## Levels
When a player adopts a Role, they are an Apprentice. As their experience grows, they [[level up]].

>**Epistemology**
>
>The branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge.
