# What is a Quest?

A Quest is a *truth-seeking journey* from a [[question]] (an existing [[node]]) to its answer (a new child [[node]]). It is a large scale conversation, known as a Dialogue Map, and is recorded in the K-Hub.

You can join any Quest you like.

These conversations necessarily include debate, which takes the form of Pro and Con arguments and the justifications for those arguments. SenseQuest strongly encourages the best possible justifications for such solutions (e.g., evidence and provenance).

During Quests, [[../|sensecraft]] encourages and rewards [[conversational literacy]].

We anticipate two types of Quests:

-   Isolated Quests to develop novel solutions for specific problems.
-   In the Quest/[[guild]]/[[k-hub]] model, only [[guild]]s can provide curated Quest results to the Questâ€™s associated [[k-hub]].

Okay then, [[create a quest]]?
